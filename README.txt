
collective.hostout is a zc.buildout recipe used to create a script for deploying your buildout.
You can use it to create a hosting environment for your local buildout and then repeatedly
deploy your buildout and custom code to that host. It uses Plone Unified installer to prepare 
the host and fabric from controlling the host.
